        These are summary numbers extracted from Airbnb's open data.
        Earliest review was from June 2011.
        </br></br>
        While there are 956 homeless people in the city, they offer the same number of rooms as 37 hotels with 500 rooms each. Although these figures are added up until
        October 2018, in <a href="https://www.airbnbcitizen.com/airbnb-community-generated-more-than-e1-billion-in-barcelona-in-2016/">this</a> link they are presenting 16.100 hosts who earned â‚¬167 million just in 2016.
       </br></br>
       Note that the earnings showed are just computed taking into account
       the minimum number of nights listed.
